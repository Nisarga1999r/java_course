Interview questions

1. Why is Java a platform independent language?
Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code which can be run on multiple systems.

The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it.
2. Why is Java not a pure object oriented language?
Java supports primitive data types - byte, boolean, char, short, int, float, long, and double and hence it is not a pure object-oriented language.

3. Pointers are used in C/ C++. Why does Java not make use of pointers?
Pointers are quite complicated and unsafe to use by beginner programmers. Java focuses on code simplicity, and the usage of pointers can make it challenging. Pointer utilization can also cause potential errors. Moreover, security is also compromised if pointers are used because the users can directly access memory with the help of pointers.

Thus, a certain level of abstraction is furnished by not including pointers in Java. Moreover, the usage of pointers can make the procedure of garbage collection quite slow and erroneous. Java makes use of references as these cannot be manipulated, unlike pointers.
. What do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?
Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. These variables describe the properties of an object and remain bound to it at any cost.

All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables for utilization. If any modification is done on these variables, then only that instance will be impacted by it, and all other class instances continue to remain unaffected.
class Athlete {
public String athleteName;
public double athleteSpeed;
public int athleteAge;
}

Local variables are those variables present within a block, function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope. Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the other class methods donâ€™t have any knowledge about the local variable.

public void athlete() {
String athleteName;
double athleteSpeed;
int athleteAge;
}
